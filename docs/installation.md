# Installation 
We recommend that you set up our [simple demo]({{ framlinks.demo }}){:target="_blank"} to get started with FRAM. This demo will install all the packages that you need together with an open source power market model [JulES]({{ juleslinks.jules }}){:target="_blank"} so that you can run a simple modelling case and see how FRAM works. 
To install the demo run:

      pip install fram-demo

To install FRAM packages separately use:

      pip install fram-core  
<br>

      pip install fram-data
      
<br>
      pip install fram-jules
