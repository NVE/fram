# Installation and demo

We recommend that you set up our simple demo to get started with FRAM. Go to the [demo page on GitHub]({{ framlinks.demo }}){:target="_blank"} and follow the installation steps. 

Demo installation will install all necessary dependenies for FRAM and all FRAM packages. It will also install an open-source power market model JulES and a demo dataset so that you can run a simple modelling case and see how FRAM works. 

## Separate installation of FRAM packages and demo dataset

If you still want to install different packages separately, you can use:

      pip install fram-core  
<br>

      pip install fram-data
      
<br>

      pip install fram-jules     

<br>

To download the dataset separately, go to [FRAM demo dataset]({{ framlinks.dataset }}){:target="_blank"} and download the zip-file.
