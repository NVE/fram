# Why we developed FRAM

At [the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE)](https://www.nve.no/){:target="_blank"} modelling is widely used to understand short-term and long-term developments in the power market. The possibility to run many models, many scenarios and compare them with each other is crucial for understanding the increasing complexity of the changing energy system. We saw a clear need to create a system that enables flexible and efficient use of different energy and power market models as different models are good at solving different problems. Therefore, we developed this modelling framework FRAM to support our analysts so that we could continue delivering quick and high-quality analyses in the future.  
 
Over time, we have transitioned from a fragmented landscape of Python scripts developed by different individuals, along with manual data handling and orchestration between models, to a unified system that meets our needs and ambitions. FRAM users can easily run the models they need, switch between models, and compare results — all within a unified and user-friendly environment. FRAM simplifies onboarding and training of new employees, reduces the risk of errors, and promotes consistency in analysis as all energy market models are built from the same database. We also wanted a modular system built on fast, efficient code and smart solutions — a tool that empowers both analysts and developers to work more effectively and collaboratively. 

Transparency has been a key priority. FRAM is completely open-source, and we at NVE hope that this system will be adopted by the industry and academia and will benefit the whole society. We encourage external stakeholders to contribute to FRAM development and create APIs for different power- and energy market models.   

FRAM has been developed by a team of professional Python developers in collaboration with NVE’s analysts, combining domain expertise in energy system analysis and modelling with professional software development skills. This collaboration between analysts and developers has ensured a robust framework that balances technical performance with practical usability — tailored to the needs of both users and contributors.
